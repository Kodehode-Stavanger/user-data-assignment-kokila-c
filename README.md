# User data assignment

Hey! This week we've seen how we can use Javascript to make a fairly full featured To do list application with editing, deleting, sorting and filtering. **Your assignment is to use some of what we covered to make a web app of your own**.

You will have pretty much full creative freedom to make whatever you want, but this functionality is mandatory:

- The app should receive data from the user through a form
- The app should process and/or display this data
- The app should use localStorage to persist the data
- The CSS/design has to be clean and functional
- _Make sure to activate GitHub Pages on your app_

You **don't** need to implement all the functionality I had in my todo list. _But_, feel free to challenge yourself and consider sorting/filtering or similar functionality as **optional** stretch goals. Also, you **don't** need to make a todo list! Here are some suggestions for things you could make if you can't think of anything:

- ### Recipe Manager

  Build an application where users can store and organize their recipes. They can add recipes, categorize them (e.g., by cuisine, meal type), add ingredients, and instructions. You can also include features like a search function, favorite recipes, and sharing capabilities.

- ### Book Tracker

  Create a web app that allows users to keep track of the books they've read, want to read, or are currently reading. Users can add books, rate them, write reviews, and categorize them by genre or author. You can also incorporate features like recommendations based on user preferences or a book club discussion forum.

- ### Fitness Tracker

  Develop a fitness tracking app where users can log their workouts, set fitness goals, track their progress, and monitor their nutrition intake. Users can input exercises, record sets and reps, track their weight and body measurements, and view graphs and statistics of their progress over time.

- ### Budget Planner

  Build an application to help users manage their finances by tracking income, expenses, and savings goals. Users can categorize their transactions, set budgets for different expense categories, view spending trends, and receive alerts for upcoming bills or budget overages.

- ### Task Scheduler

  Create a task scheduling app similar to a to-do list but with more advanced scheduling capabilities. Users can schedule tasks and appointments on a calendar, set reminders and notifications, and view their schedule in daily, weekly, or monthly views. You can also include features like recurring tasks, time-blocking, and integration with external calendars like Google Calendar.

- ### Travel Planner

  Develop a travel planning app where users can plan and organize their trips. Users can create itineraries, add destinations, book flights and accommodations, create packing lists, and share their travel plans with friends or family. You can also include features like budget tracking, local recommendations, and interactive maps.

- ### Study Buddy

  Build a study planner and collaboration platform for students. Users can create study schedules, set goals, track their study hours, and join study groups or sessions with classmates. You can include features like flashcards, quizzes, progress tracking, and discussion forums for collaborative learning.

- ### Home Inventory Manager
  Create an app to help users inventory their belongings and organize their home. Users can categorize items by room, add photos and descriptions, track purchase dates and warranty information, and generate reports for insurance purposes. You can also include features like barcode scanning, price tracking, and reminders for maintenance tasks.
